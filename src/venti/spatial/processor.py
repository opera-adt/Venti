class SpatialProcessor:
    """Wrapper around windowed polynomial plane fitting for InSAR calibration.

    Provides a single :meth:`fit_windowed_surface` method that estimates the
    long-wavelength bias between an InSAR displacement field and a GNSS LOS
    reference surface using a moving-window least-squares polynomial fit.

        Fits a windowed polynomial plane to the difference between
        `insar_data` and `gnss_los`, returning the estimated bias
        surface. Apply the correction as ``calibrated = insar_data - surface``.

        Parameters
        ----------
        insar_data : np.ndarray
            2-D InSAR displacement or velocity array.
        gnss_los : np.ndarray
            2-D GNSS LOS reference field (same shape as `insar_data`).
        window_size_x : int
            Window width in pixels.
        window_size_y : int
            Window height in pixels.
        window_overlap_x : int, optional
            Window overlap in the x direction, by default ``10``.
        window_overlap_y : int, optional
            Window overlap in the y direction, by default ``10``.
        window_extend_x : int, optional
            Extra columns of context added around each window for fitting.
            Defaults to `window_size_x` when not given.
        window_extend_y : int, optional
            Extra rows of context added around each window for fitting.
            Defaults to `window_size_y` when not given.
        gnss_los_std : np.ndarray, optional
            Uncertainty of the GNSS LOS field (reserved for future weighted
            inversion; currently unused).
        poly_order : float, optional
            Polynomial order for plane fitting, by default ``1.5``.
        n_jobs : int, optional
            Number of parallel ``joblib`` workers, by default ``-1`` (all CPUs).
        smoothing_sigma : float, optional
            Standard deviation (pixels) passed to the post-assembly low-pass
            filter.  Ignored when ``smoothing_method="savitzky_golay"``.
            ``None`` disables smoothing.
        smoothing_method : str, optional
            Post-assembly low-pass filter.  One of ``"gaussian"`` (default),
            ``"gaussian_fft"``, ``"hanning_fft"``, or ``"savitzky_golay"``.
        sg_window_length : int, optional
            Window length for Savitzky-Golay in pixels (must be odd),
            by default ``51``.
        sg_polyorder : int, optional
            Polynomial order for Savitzky-Golay, by default ``3``.

        -------
